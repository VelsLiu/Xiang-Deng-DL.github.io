# Bio

This is [Xiang Deng][Xiang Deng], a third year PhD candidate at [MRL Lab][MRL Lab] at [State University of New York at Binghamton][State University of New York at Binghamton]. I am working with [Prof. Zhongfei Zhang][Prof. Zhongfei Zhang]. I aim to design simple but very effcitive deep learning approaches. Simplicity yet effectiveness is the best. Prior to joining SUNY-Binghamton, I obtained B.Eng. in Software Engineering and M.Eng. in Computer Science and Techonology from [Shandong University][Shandong University] in 2015 and 2018, respectively.
