# Bio

This is [Xiang Deng][Xiang Deng], a PhD candidate at [MRL Lab][MRL Lab] at [State University of New York at Binghamton][State University of New York at Binghamton]. I am working with [Prof. Zhongfei Zhang][Prof. Zhongfei Zhang]. I aim to design simple but very effective deep learning approaches. Simplicity yet effectiveness is the best. My research experience is mainly on deep learning methods & computer vision, knowledge distillation & supervised learning, GANs & image processing (e.g., enhancement), and deep metric learning. Prior to joining SUNY-Binghamton, I obtained the Bachelor's and Master's degrees from [Shandong University][Shandong University] in 2015 and 2018, respectively.
